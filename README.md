Create a project which will demonstrate a culmination of all of the topics i have covered in my training. It will involve the following concepts and technologies:
* Project Management
* Python Fundamentals
* Python Testing
* Git
* Linux
* Python Web Development
* Databases
* Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
* Cloud Fundamentals
* Containerisation

### Objective
* To create a web application that integrates with a database and demonstrates CRUD functionality.
* To utilise containers to host and deploy your application.
* To create a continuous integration (CI)/continuous deployment (CD) pipeline that will automatically test, build and deploy your application.

### How I Approched This <a name="approach"></a>
To acheive the objective I decided to create an game tracking app to allow a user to do the following:

* Store game details(satisfy 'Create')
 * Game name
 * Release year 
 * Genre
 * Developer
 * Publisher
 * Platform
 * Do they own the game
 * Do they want to add the game to a wishlist
 * Are they currently playing the game
 * Have they completed the game
* Allow game to be moved from wishlist to owned, then remove it from wishlist(satisfy 'Update' and 'Delete')
* Allow game to be moved from currently playing to completed, then remove it from currently playing(satisfy 'Update' and 'Delete')
* Allow game to ba added to Currently playing from owend games(satisfy 'Update')
* Allow user to view a table of owned games(satisfy 'Read')
* Allow user to view a table of games in wishlist(satisfy 'Read')
* Allow user to view a table of games currently playing(satisfy 'Read')
* Allow user to view a table of games completed(satisfy 'Read')

## Project Tracking <a name="tracking"></a>
To help manage my project I decided to use jira software to track and manage my project. I used it to display.
* MoSCoW prioritisation

* User stories

* Estimations of effort (e.g. story points)
I included the story points estimates on each item within jira
